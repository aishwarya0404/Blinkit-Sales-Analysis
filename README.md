# Blinkit-Sales-Analysis using Power Bi
Analyzing sales data to identify trends and insights with interactive dashboards and visualizations. Focuses on sales performance across different dimensions like time, region, and product categories.


1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - I started with the `BlinkIt grocery Dataset.xlsx`, which contains sales data including details like date, region, product categories, and sales figures.
   - The raw data was cleaned and transformed in Power BI to handle missing values, standardize formats, and create calculated columns for analysis.

2. **Data Modeling**:
   - Created relationships between different tables in the dataset to enable comprehensive analysis.
   - Defined calculated measures and columns for metrics like total sales, sales growth, and average order value using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Developed various interactive visualizations using Power BI, including:
     - **Sales Trend Analysis**: Line charts to show sales performance over time.
     - **Regional Performance**: Maps and bar charts to analyze sales by region.
     - **Product Category Insights**: Pie charts and stacked bar charts to highlight top-selling product categories.
     - **Seasonal Patterns**: Heatmaps to identify sales patterns based on seasons and holidays.
   
4. **Insights and Findings**:
   - Analyzed the visualizations to identify key sales trends, peak sales periods, and high-performing regions and product categories.
   - Generated insights on customer preferences and sales drivers, helping to inform strategic decision-making for marketing and inventory management.

5. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Built an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter data by various dimensions such as time period, region, and product category.
   - The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Blinkit's sales performance, helping stakeholders quickly understand the data
